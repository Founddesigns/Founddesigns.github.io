          <h2>1. Design Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
          <h4>1. Graphic Design</h4>
          <p>If a choice of design is presented, only one solution is deemed to be given by Founddesigns.de as fulfilling the contract. <strong>All other designs remain the property of Founddesigns.de</strong>, unless agreed in writing that this arrangement has been changed.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>2. Design Charges</h4>
          <p>Charges for design services to be provided by Founddesigns.de, will be set out in the written cost estimate or invoice provided to the Client. At the time of the Client&#x27;s acceptance of this cost estimate or quotation, indicating acceptance of the Terms &amp; Conditions, a non-refundable deposit of 50% of the quoted fee will become immediately due. Work on the project will not commence until Founddesigns.de has received this or the full amount.</p>
          <p>Alternatively, the client may send an official order in reply to the cost estimate or quotation which binds the client to accept Founddesigns.de terms and conditions. No work on a project will commence until either document, as well as the required deposit, have been received by Founddesigns.de.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>3. Charges for Other Services</h4>
          <p>Charges for any additional services over and above the estimated design cost, will become fully payable (100% of the quoted amount) at the time of estimate or quotation acceptance (for example, printing or copywriting costs etc.).</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>4. Proofs and Drafts</h4>
          <p>All work may be submitted for the Client&#x27;s approval. Founddesigns.de shall incur no liability for any errors not corrected by the Client in works so submitted. The Client&#x27;s alterations and additional proofs necessitated thereby shall be charged extra. When content, style, type or layout is left to Founddesigns.de judgement, changes therefrom made by the Client shall be charged extra. </p>
          <p>No responsibility will be accepted for differences between proofs and work supplied to the Client where the methods of production differ. A slight variation in colour is inherent with the CMYK print process. Founddesigns.de cannot be held responsible for minor colour discrepancies.<br><br><strong>Visual Design</strong> – All visuals of progressive development will be emailed to the Client as a JPG file. Please be aware that all monitors display color differently. To ensure that the colour is correct, it is highly recommended that the Client views a colour matching book or the final proof supplied by the printing company. A print ready PDF file will be supplied to the client once the artwork has been approved and paid in full. <br><br><strong>Website Design</strong> – All visuals of progressive development will be emailed to the Client as a JPG file, or displayed using a private URL that is not visible to the general public. The final website will be set live once the approved and paid for in full.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>5. Errors and Omissions</h4>
          <p>It is the Client&#x27;s responsibility to check proofs carefully for accuracy in all respects, ranging from spelling to technical illustrations. Founddesigns.de is not liable for errors or omissions. The Client&#x27;s signature or that of an authorised representative is required on all mechanicals or artwork prior to release for printing or other implementation.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>6. Signing Off Project Release Note</h4>
          <p>Once final print or electronic artwork is approved the Client is required to sign an approval form to agree that it is ready for printing or other implementation. This signature implies that the Client is satisfied with the artwork and consents to it being printed or, in the case of a website, made live.<br><br>The Client agrees to fully indemnify and hold Founddesigns.de harmless in any and all claims resulting from errors on the print or electronic documents once the Client has signed off on the artwork.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>7. Design Project Duration</h4>
          <p>Any indication given by Founddesigns.de of a design project&#x27;s duration is to be considered by the Client to be an estimation only. Founddesigns.de cannot be held responsible for any project overruns, whatever the cause. Estimated project duration should be deemed to be from the date that cleared funds are received by Founddesigns.de for the initial payment or by date confirmed in writing by Founddesigns.de.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>8. Design Project Completion</h4>
          <p>Founddesigns.de considers the design project complete upon receipt of the Client&#x27;s signed Approval form. Other services such as printing, copywriter, search engine optimization, website uploading, publishing and the like contracted on the Clients behalf constitute a separate project and can be treated as a separate charge.<br></p>

          <h1>2. Pricing Terms &amp; Conditions </h1>
          <h4>9. Payment</h4>
          <p>The Client agrees to pay Founddesigns.de in accordance with the terms specified in each proposal/estimate. Clients will be required to pay 50% of the project cost before work can begin, unless otherwise stated in writing. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent balances are payable upon artwork approval, or within 30 days of project commencement, whichever comes first.<br><br>All payments are non-refundable and required even if deliverables are not used by client.<br><br>Founddesigns.de reserves the right to remove all web content from the Internet if payment is not made within thirty (30)days of completion notification. If case collection proves necessary, Client agrees to pay all fees incurred in that process. Regardless of the place of signing this agreement, Client agrees that for the purposes of venue, this contract was entered into in Johannesburg, South Africa, and any dispute will be litigated or arbitrated in Johannesburg, South Africa.<br><br>The Client will be provided with an Approval Form and Invoice prior to final publication. At this time the remainder of the amount due will become payable and the Client will also be required to sign and return the Approval Form to Founddesigns.de. Should payment not be made within thirty (30) days of notification, the balance outstanding incurs a 2.5% monthly compounded interest penalty. Failure to produce payment after sixty (60) days will be handed over to debt collectors.<br><br>Any changes required to the project after signed off will be charged at our hourly rate. Should Founddesigns.de provide the client with the requested artwork, but fails to receive feedback from the Client within a thirty (30) day period, the balance of the invoice becomes payable immediately.<br><br>Should Founddesigns.de not reach the client in any way whatsoever or alternatively if the client does not provide any written feedback within 10 working days of the last change request, causing the project to stall in any way whatsoever, Founddesigns.de will mark the project as dormant and accordingly the dormant project will be removed from the active project list. A 30% cost of the total project invoice will be levied by Founddesigns.de to the Client and must be paid to reactivate the project and continue thereafter.<br><br>Should the project remain dormant for a period of more than 6 months, the project will be terminated and all design source files will be removed from Founddesigns.de network and all costs paid by the client to Founddesigns.de will be forfeited due to the Clients breach of the terms and conditions without prejudice to any other claims Founddesigns.de may have against the client for damages.<br><br>Payments may be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT), or creditcard. No cheques are accepted. Cash deposits will incur a 10% fee for bank charges.<br><br>Publication, printing and/or release of work done by Founddesigns.de on behalf of the client, may not take place before funds have been received.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>10. Refunds</h4>
          <p>All payments are non-refundable and required even if deliverables are not used by client.</p>
          <p> </p>
          <h4>11. Default</h4>
          <p>An account shall be considered in default if it remains unpaid for 30 days from the date of invoice Founddesigns.de shall cease all work on design projects, and will be entitled to retain copyright of all work, until final payment has been made. Ceasing of work does not relieve the Client of its obligation to pay the due amount.</p>
          <p>Clients whose accounts become default agree to pay Founddesigns.de reasonable legal expenses and third party collection agency fees in the enforcement of these Terms and Conditions.</p>
          <p>Claims Advice of damage, dissatisfaction of condition, delay or partial loss of goods in transit or of non delivered, must be given in writing to Founddesigns.de and the carrier within three clear days of delivery. (In the case of non-delivery, within twenty-eight (28) days of dispatch of the goods).</p>
          <p>All other claims must be made in writing to Founddesigns.de within seven (7) calendar days (5 working days) of delivery. Founddesigns.de shall not be liable in respect of any claim unless the requirements have been complied with except in any particular case where the Client proves that it was not possible to comply with the requirements.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h4>12. Revisions and Alterations</h4>
          <p>New work requested by the Client and performed by Founddesigns.de after a proposal/cost estimate has been approved is considered a revision or alteration. If the job changes to an extent that substantially alters the specifications described in the original estimate, Founddesigns.de will submit a cost estimate revision to the Client and a revised additional fee must be agreed to by both parties before further work proceeds.</p>
          <p>The Client agrees that changes required over and above the estimated work or required to be carried out after acceptance of the draft design will be liable to a separate charge.</p>
